# Notes: 
#
#   1. How to read this file:
#      Lines beginning with # are comments. Most comments in this file explain what a given
#      keybinding does.
#      Unindented lines that do not begin with a # are keybindings.
#      Lines indented with a tab are the actual commands corresponding to the respective
#      keybindings. If you are here to learn how to use this window manager, you can ignore
#      these. The reason they're here is that this is an actual configuration file (with comments)
#      on top of being a reference file for humans.
#      Comma-separated items inside curly brackets { } represent alternatives, for brevity.
#
#   2. The "super" key is normally between the Ctrl and Alt keys,
#      known to Windows users as the "Windows" key and to Mac users as the "command" key.
#   
#   3. "grave" = backtick, i.e. `. (Used in one key combo.)
#
#   4. Some of my comments mention a (binary) tree. That's because this window manager internally
#      represents the windows as being the leaves of a full binary tree. Hence its name, bspwm, for
#      Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager. This stuff is perfectly safe to ignore.

# Close bspwm (i.e. the window manager. Closing it will leave you with a windowless command-line
# environment. You can then enter "startx" to relaunch bspwm.)
